# vision_transformer_pytorch

## Overview
This ViT architecture was an attempt at reproducing the architecture described in the paper titled "AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:
TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE" [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf)]. This implementation utilized the PyTorch framework as opposed to the JAX/Flax framework used in the paper. As a starting point, we relied on the PyTorch implementation described in the blog post [[2](https://medium.com/@brianpulfer/vision-transformers-from-scratch-pytorch-a-step-by-step-guide-96c3313c2e0c)] as a baseline.
